### Email 4: Final Check-In (Send 10 days after estimate if no response)
**Subject:** Should I close your file, [First Name]?

---

Hi [First Name],

I haven't heard back about the painting estimate I sent for [Property Address], so I wanted to check in one last time.

**A few possibilities:**
- The timing isn't right (totally fine—projects get delayed)
- You're still comparing options (smart—happy to answer questions)
- The scope or price needs adjustment (let's talk)
- You went another direction (no hard feelings)

**If you're still interested:** Just reply and let me know where you stand. I'm happy to adjust the quote, answer questions, or hold your spot on the schedule while you decide.

**If you've moved on:** No problem at all. Just hit reply and say "pass for now"—I won't bug you again, but I'll keep your info on file in case things change.

Either way, thanks for considering Red Door Painting Pros. I hope we get a chance to work together down the road.

## 2. Reactivation Campaign (319 Stale Estimates)

### Sequence A: Day 14 Reactivation
**Subject:** Still thinking about painting? Here's 10% off [First Name]

---

Hi [First Name],

A couple weeks ago, I sent you an estimate for painting work at [Property Address]. I know timing doesn't always work out as planned, so I wanted to reach back out.

**Here's what I'm offering:**
If you book your project in the next 14 days, I'll take **10% off** the estimate I sent you.

That brings your project from $[Original] down to $[Discounted].

**Why now?**
- Lock in current pricing (materials costs keep climbing)
- Beat the [season] rush
- Get your project done before [relevant event/holiday]

**No obligation to commit today.** Just reply to this email or call 520-500-3791 and say "I'm interested in the 10% discount." I'll hold the price for 14 days while you decide.

Talk soon,

Joel

📞 520-500-3791

P.S. If you've already hired someone else or decided not to paint, just hit reply and let me know. I'll close your file—no hard feelings.

### Sequence B: Day 30 Reactivation
**Subject:** [First Name], your estimate expires soon

---

Hi [First Name],

Wanted to reach out one more time about the painting estimate I sent you for [Property Address].

**Quick reality check:**
Material costs have gone up twice since I sent your quote. If I re-estimated your project today, it would cost approximately $[Higher Amount].

**The good news:** I'll honor your original estimate price for 7 more days.

After that, I'll need to re-quote at current rates.

**To lock in your price:** Just reply "HOLD MY PRICE" and I'll keep your estimate valid for 30 more days. No deposit required, no commitment—just a price hold.

If you've decided not to move forward, no worries—just reply "PASS" and I'll close your file.

### Sequence C: Day 90 Reactivation
**Subject:** [First Name], one last check-in

---

Hi [First Name],

It's been a few months since we talked about your painting project at [Property Address]. I'm doing some end-of-quarter cleanup and wanted to reach out one last time.

**Three quick questions:**
1. Did you get your painting done (with us or someone else)?
2. If not, are you still planning to?
3. Is there anything that would make Red Door the obvious choice?

If you're still planning to paint, I'd love another shot at earning your business. I'm happy to:
- Re-estimate with current pricing
- Adjust scope to fit your budget
- Answer any questions that came up since we last talked

If you went another direction, I'd love to know why—helps me improve for future customers.

**Either way, just reply and let me know.** I promise this is the last email unless you tell me you're interested.

Thanks,
